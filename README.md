# CMake Examples For Beginners  
It wasn't hard to find minimal CMakeLists.txt files, but very few seemed to include basic package integration, so for those looking for a gentle starting point regarding integrating C++ libraries such as Boost, Poco, or Qt with CMake you're welcome to use my files as reference. 

*Since I use MacOS the libraries listed in this project were installed with Homebrew.*
